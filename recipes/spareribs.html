        <h1>Chinese Spareibs</h1>

        <img src="./spareribsPic" alt="Spareribs picture">

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These Chinese spareribs are tender, juicy, and tangy. I created this recipe after nothing caught my eye while searching for a good sparerib recipe. I cooked this in the broiler in Japan, but it should be fine on the grill or in the oven.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 pound pork spareribs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix together hoisin sauce, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, and five-spice powder in a shallow glass dish. Place ribs in the dish and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a broiler tray with enough water to cover the bottom. Place the grate or a rack over the tray; arrange ribs on the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated oven on the center rack for 40 minutes, turning and brushing with marinade every 10 minutes. Let marinade cook on for final 10 minutes to make a glaze. Finish under the broiler if desired. Discard any remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
