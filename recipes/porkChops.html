        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk too.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 2/3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</li>
            <li>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill.  Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the centre, about 7 to 9 minutes per side.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centre should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
